## This is a repo containing rust algo's and my answers for them as I learn the Rust language.

#### To test any rust algo:

cd into the repo  
make sure cargo / rust is installed  
cargo run (to run the main function)  
or  
cargo test. Some of the items are ran using cargo run, but I am transitioning those to use cargo test as well.
